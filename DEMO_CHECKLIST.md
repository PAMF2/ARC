### 30-Second Pitch
> "We built Stripe for AI agents. Autonomous agents get Circle wallets, pay for services in USDC, use consensus to approve transactions, settle on Arc blockchain, and Gemini AI optimizes everything."

### 2-Minute Demo Flow
1. [0-10s] Agent creation
2. [10-25s] Autonomous payments
3. [25-45s] Consensus voting
4. [45-70s] Arc settlement
5. [70-80s] AI analytics
